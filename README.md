## **Project 2 – Power BI**

I decided to use my own dataset – [the results of the presidential elections in the Czech Republic in 2023](https://www.volby.cz/opendata/prez2023/prez2023_opendata.htm)

### Criteria
- 2-3 pages in length;
- Use of at least 5 different types of visuals;
- Filtering with slicers;
- Use of bookmarks/page navigation;
- Linking multiple data sources, either in Power Query or in Power BI;
- Use of a data hierarchy of at least two levels;
- Creating at least 1 measure (metric/measure) and 1 calculated column;
- Graphical editing of the used visuals and a visually appealing final report.
